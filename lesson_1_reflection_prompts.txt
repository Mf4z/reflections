How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It shows where the codes were added or removed form the compare version

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It helps you move from your newer version of code to an older one and helps you keep track of your progress

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: Allows you to commit logical changes easily,gives you control of when to commit when it a feature is complete and needs to be commited
    Cons: Might save feature when is not completely built,might save unfinised work 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It allows for related files to be commited together and makes it easier to manage

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   Git log is used to find commit Ids then git diff is used for compare the difference between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You could go back to a previous woking code at anytime

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
